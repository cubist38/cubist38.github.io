Welcome to my [blog](https://cubist38.github.io)! If you are interested in a career in data science, it is important to have a strong foundation in **statistics and probability**. Data scientists use these tools to collect, organize, analyze, and interpret data in order to make informed decisions. **Statistics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It is used to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of that population. **Probability** is the study of chance events. It is used to predict the likelihood of future events happening.
