**Statistics** and probability are fundamental to data science, serving as the backbone for making sense of complex data. 
They provide the mathematical foundation necessary to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within data.
Statistics allows us to summarize, describe, and interpret data, while probability helps us predict future events based on past data. Together, they enable us to make informed decisions and predictions, quantify uncertainty, test hypotheses, and build machine learning models. Without statistics and probability, data science would lack the rigorous methodology needed to extract meaningful insights from data.
