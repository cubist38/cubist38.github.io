        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This guide provides an introduction to Probability, a crucial concept in Data Science. 
            To begin with, we will discuss about the basic topics of Probability, such as  binomial distribution, 
            central limit theorem, normal distribution, and Z-score. Each concept is explained in a simple, non-mathematical
            manner and illustrated with examples.

        <h2>Probability and its Significance</h2>
        <h3>What is the Probability?</h3>
        <p>Probability is a fundanmental concept in Data Science that quantifies the 
            likelihood of an event or outcome. The probability of an event is always between 0 and 1. If the probability of an event
is 0, 
            it means that the event is impossible. On the other hand, if the probability of an event is 1, it means that
            the event is certain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Life is inherently uncertain, with outcomes of various situations remaining unknown until 
            they occur. Questions about weather, academic success, sports outcomes, and career advancements 
exemplify these uncertainties. These scenarios will be related to common terminologies used in our subsequent discussion:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experiment</strong>: refers to situations with uncertain outcomes, such as daily weather patterns.</ali>
                <li><strong>Outcome</strong>: is the result of a single instance of an experiment. 
                    For instance, if it is a sunny day, the outcome of today's weather experiment is "Sunny day"</li>
                <li><strong>Event</strong>: is one or more outcome from an experiment. "Sunny day" is a possible event for the weather experiment.</li>
                <li><strong>Probability</strong>: quantifies the likelihood of an event. If there’s a 
    80% chance of rain tomorrow, the probability of the outcome “Sunny day” for tomorrow’s weather experiment is 0.8.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>
            Probability allows Data Scientists to make sense of data and 
            build reliable models. It is used in a wide variety of tasks, including 
            data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing.
            For example, a data scientist might use probability to develop a model to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting 
            on a loan, recommend products to customers based on their past purchase history, or predict the risk of a patient developing a certain disease.
    robability is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems in data science. By understanding probability, data scientists can make better decisions and build more reliable models.

        <h2>Random variables</h2>
        <p>
            A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical 
            value to each outcome of a random experiment. Random variables can be either discrete or continuous.
        </p>
        <h3>Discrete Random Variable</h3>
        <p>
      A discrete random variable is a random variable that can only take on a finite number of distinct values, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. 
            The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is a list of the probabilities associated with each of its possible values. This list is known as the 
            <strong>propability mass function </strong> (PMF). The PMF of a discrete random variable must satisfy two conditions:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Condition 1</strong>: The probability of each value of the discrete random variable must be between 0 and 1.</li>
                <li><strong>Condition 2</strong>: The sum of the probabilities of all the values of the discrete random variable must be 1.</li>
            </ul>
    <p>
        For instance, suppose we are interested in the number of heads that will 
        appear when a coin is tossed three times. The possible values of the random variable X are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    The PMF of X is given by:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Value</th>
                    <th>Probability</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr style="background-color: #ff9999;">
                    <td>$0$</td>
                    <td>$0.1$</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background-color: #ffff99;">
                    <td>$1$</td>
                    <td>$0.4$</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background-color: #99ff99;">
                    <td>$2$</td>
       <td>$0.3$</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background-color: #999cff;">
                    <td>$3$</td>
                    <td>$0.2$</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>The table provides the following probabilities for a discrete random variable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There's a <strong>10%</strong> chance of getting <strong>0</strong> ($P(X=0) = 0.1$)</li>
            <li>There's a <strong>40%</strong> chance of getting <strong>1</strong> ($P(X=1) = 0.4$)</li>
            <li>There's a <strong>30%</strong> chance of getting <strong>2</strong> ($P(X=2) = 0.3$)</li>
            <li>There's a <strong>20%</strong> chance of getting <strong>3</strong> ($P(X=3) = 0.2$)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The sum of these probabilities gives us a total of <strong>100%</strong> ($0.1 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 1$), which confirms that the sum of the probabilities for all possible values of the discrete random variable is indeed <strong>1</strong>, as it should be in any probability distribution.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Continuous Random Variable</h3>
    <p>
        A continuous random variable is a random variable that can take on any value in an interval. 
        This means that there are infinitely many possible values for the variable. Continuous random 
        variables are often used to represent quantities that can be measured infinitely precisely, such as height, weight, or temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
        In detail, examples of continuous random variables include:
        <ul>
            <li>The amount of rain in a city in a year</li>
            <li>The height of a randomly selected person</li>
            <li>The time it takes to complete a task</li>
            <li>The temperature on a given day</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is known as the <strong>probability density function</strong> (PDF). 
        The PDF of a continuous random variable must satisfy two conditions:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condition 1</strong>: The probability of each value of the continuous random variable must be between 0 and 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition 2</strong>: The area under the PDF curve must be 1.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To calculate the probability that a continuous random variable will take on a value in a given interval,
        we need to integrate the PDF over that interval. For example, if the PDF of a continuous random variable X 
        is given by $f(x)$, and we want to calculate the probability that X will take on a value between a and b, we would use the following formula:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$</p>
    <p>
        Here are some examples of probability density functions for continuous random variables:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uniform distribution</strong>: The probability of any value between a and b is the same. The PDF of a uniform distribution is given by $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$.</li>
            <li><strong>Normal distribution</strong>: The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric about the mean. The PDF of a normal distribution is given by $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$.</li>
            <li><strong>Exponential distribution</strong>: The exponential distribution is used to model the time between events that occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. The PDF of an exponential distribution is given by $f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$.</li>
        </ul>
    </p> -->
    <p>
        The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is known as the <strong>probability density function</strong> (PDF). 
        Suppose X is a continuous random variable with a probability distribution function $\displaystyle F_X(x)$. If the function $\displaystyle f_X(x)$ exists such that:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">$\displaystyle F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^xf_X(t)dt$</p>
    <p>
        then $\displaystyle f_X​(x)$ is called the <strong>probability density function</strong> (PDF) of the random variable X.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PDF of a continuous random variable must satisfy three conditions:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condition 1</strong>: $\displaystyle f_X(x) \geq 0, \forall x \in &#8477;$</li>
            <li><strong>Condition 2</strong>: $\displaystyle P(a < X < b) = \int_a^bf_X(x)dx$</li>
            <li><strong>Condition 3</strong>: $\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_X(x)dx = 1$</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some examples of probability density functions for continuous random variables:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uniform distribution</strong>: The probability of any value between a and b is the same. The PDF of a uniform distribution is given by $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$.</li>
            <li><strong>Normal distribution</strong>: The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric about the mean. The PDF of a normal distribution is given by $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$.</li>
            <li><strong>Exponential distribution</strong>: The exponential distribution is used to model the time between events that occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. The PDF of an exponential distribution is given by $f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$.</li>
        </ul>
