        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This guide provides an introduction to Probability, a crucial concept in Data Science. 
            To begin with, we will discuss about the basic topics of Probability, such as  binomial distribution, 
            central limit theorem, normal distribution, and Z-score. Each concept is explained in a simple, non-mathematical
            manner and illustrated with examples.

        <h2>Probability and its Significance</h2>
        <h3>What is the Probability?</h3>
        <p>Probability is a fundanmental concept in Data Science that quantifies the 
            likelihood of an event or outcome. The probability of an event is always between 0 and 1. If the probability of an event is 0, 
            it means that the event is impossible. On the other hand, if the probability of an event is 1, it means that
            the event is certain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Life is inherently uncertain, with outcomes of various situations remaining unknown until 
            they occur. Questions about weather, academic success, sports outcomes, and career advancements 
            exemplify these uncertainties. These scenarios will be related to common terminologies used in our subsequent discussion:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experiment</strong>: refers to situations with uncertain outcomes, such as daily weather patterns.</ali>
                <li><strong>Outcome</strong>: is the result of a single instance of an experiment. 
                    For instance, if it is a sunny day, the outcome of today's weather experiment is "Sunny day"</li>
                <li><strong>Event</strong>: is one or more outcome from an experiment. "Sunny day" is a possible event for the weather experiment.</li>
                <li><strong>Probability</strong>: quantifies the likelihood of an event. If there’s a 
                    80% chance of rain tomorrow, the probability of the outcome “Sunny day” for tomorrow’s weather experiment is 0.8.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>
            Probability allows Data Scientists to make sense of data and 
            build reliable models. It is used in a wide variety of tasks, including 
            data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing.
            For example, a data scientist might use probability to develop a model to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting 
            on a loan, recommend products to customers based on their past purchase history, or predict the risk of a patient developing a certain disease.
            robability is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems in data science. By understanding probability, data scientists can make better decisions and build more reliable models.
