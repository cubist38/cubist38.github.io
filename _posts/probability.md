Recently I was [reading an article](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/nirvana-kurt-cobain-ai-song-1146444/) about a cool project that intends to have a neural network create songs of the late club of the 27 (artists that have tragically died at age 27 or near, and in the height of their respective careers), artists such as Amy Winehouse, Jimmy Hendrix, Curt Cobain and Jim Morrison.
